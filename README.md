Planning:
I tried to take a methodical approach to this game and focus on one step at a time. First, being to develop my wireframes and user stories. I worked out the game logic first, and got my game to work on my client computer without connecting to the API. I made sure at this point that the game played properly, and I could rotate between players, and only click on available spaces. Then I added in the game messaging to display what is happening. I then tackled the user authentication, and finally the game api. I coded myself into a circle of dependencies and confusion, and had to reset my code to an earlier stage, and make sure I was really fulfilling every requirement before moving on the the next thing, because what starts as a small issue, if ignore, can quickly snowball into a bigger mess.

Future iterations:
I would like to make the styling more interesting, and match what I imagined in my wireframes. In my ideal world this would involve some different backgrounds, and different pictures for the characters, maybe end up with winner actually jumping in the 'Soy Sauce Pool'. I would also like a version where you can play the computer (Wasabi Monster). I would also like a version where you can play against a friend while on different computers.
